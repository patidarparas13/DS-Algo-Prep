# Graph
  Graph is set of nodes, which are also called vertex which are connected with edges

# Types Of Graph
	1. Weighted Graph
		Graphs whose edges or paths have values called weights.
		Edges value can represent weight/cost/length
	2. UnWeighted Graph
		There is no value or weight associated with the edge. 
		By default, all the graphs are unweighted unless there is a value associated
	3. Directed Graph
		Edges are directed from one node to another.
		For Example: Flights Routes, Flight Fares
	4. UnDirected Graph
		All Edges are Bi-Directional
		For Example: Friends Connected On FaceBook

# Storing a Graph
	1. Adjacency Matrix (More Memory O(V^2))
		 0 1 2 3
		0	
		1
		2
		3
		-> Advantages: If you want to find between Neighbours
	2. Adjacency List(Less MemoryO(V+E)) (More Preferred)
		0 -> (1,3)
		1 -> (2,3,0)
		2 -> (1,3)
		3 -> (2,1,0)
		
		-> Advantages: If you want to find direct neighbours
		
# Graph Traversals
	1) BFS
	2) DFS
