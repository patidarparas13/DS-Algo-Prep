### Type-1: Fixed Window length k

The length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find something in the window 
such as the maximum sum of all windows, the maximum or median number of each window. 
Usually we need kind of variables to maintain the state of the window, some are as
simple as a integer or it could be as complicated as some advanced data structure such
as list,queue or deque.

### Type-2: Two Pointers + Criteria

The window size is not fixed, usually it asks you to find the subarray that meets the criteria.
For Example: Given an array of integers, Find the number of subarrays whose sum is 
equal to a target value.
